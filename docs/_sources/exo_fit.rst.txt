================

Fit of inteference fringes
--------------------------

We would like to fit the fringes from an atom interferometer. The data are in the file (:download:`data/fit_sinus.dat <data/fit_sinus.dat>`). The first column of the file (x axis) represents a frequency in Hz. The second column (y axis) represents the population measured for the given frequency. The goal is to find the position of the central fringe. 

The fit function is a cosine function with adjustable offset, amplitude, position and width. 

* Load and plot the data. 

* Write the fit function called ``fringe(x, ....)`` 

* Find the initial parameter for the fit. 

* Calculate the optimal parameters

* What is the position and uncertainty of the central fringe ?



Fit of a picture
----------------

We have a 64x64 picture of a double star. Using the example given in the lecture, fit the picture by the sum of two gaussians and get the distance between the two stars.

Data are in the file (:download:`data/double_star <data/double_star.txt>`).
